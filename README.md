# WEIGHTLESS PLAYER

**Weightless Player** allows you to listen your favourite songs without the need of having them in your PC. Interprets lists of songs of the supported formats. Select one of them, play it, and let the music fill your ears.

## Currently playlist supported formats

* _m3u8_ (Winamp playlist)
  * Songs metadata should be correctly formatted: "$artist$ - $song$" for example "Pink Floyd - Coming Back To Life". It's usually done automatically by Winamp itself.
* _txt_ (Custom, at-hand playlist)
  * Each song should be separated by a newline.
  * Each line must be correctly formatted: "$artist$ - $song$" for example "Pink Floyd - Coming Back To Life".

## Another notes

* Find example of playlists inside "example_playlists" folder in the application package.
* At the start of the app, some windows will pop-up, this has to happen. Just wait for a few seconds, they will get closed.
* Uses YouTube in the background to find and play every song of your playlists.
* If a song doesn't get found by the system, it will skip it.

## Where can I report bugs and request new features?  
   
[:bug:](https://github.com/IgorJorobus/weightless_player/issues) 

## Known issues

* The volume may go up at a random moment (isn't sure that will happen) for a very short moment (miliseconds). If this happens to you and annoys you, just set the volume at 100% and manage it from your local main volume. It's planned to get fixed.
